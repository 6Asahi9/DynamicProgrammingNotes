### Base Cases:

* If the string has only one character (dp[i][i]), it's always a palindrome → True.
* If there are two consecutive equal characters (s[i] == s[i+1]), they form a palindrome of length 2.
### Substring Expansion (Length-Based Check):

* We start checking substrings of length 3 and beyond.
* The reason we use range(3, n + 1) is because we are checking substrings of increasing sizes, not indexes.
### Determining 'i' and 'j':

* i is the starting index, looping from 0 to n - length + 1 so we don’t go out of bounds.
* j is the ending index, found using i + length - 1 to correctly span substrings.
### Checking Palindrome Condition:

* We check if the first and last characters (s[i] == s[j]).
* Then, we check the inner part using dp[i + 1][j - 1], ensuring the substring between i and j is also a palindrome.
### Now, your last question:

What about the strings in between?

That's exactly what dp[i + 1][j - 1] is doing! Instead of checking each middle character manually, it relies on previously computed results. If the substring between i and j is already marked as True (meaning it’s a palindrome), then and only then do we set dp[i][j] = True.

That way, we build palindromes from smaller ones instead of checking each middle character every time.
