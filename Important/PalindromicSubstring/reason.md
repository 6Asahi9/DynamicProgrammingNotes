### Base Cases:

* If the string has only one character (dp[i][i]), it's always a palindrome → True.
* If there are two consecutive equal characters (s[i] == s[i+1]), they form a palindrome of length 2.
### Substring Expansion (Length-Based Check):

* We start checking substrings of length 3 and beyond.
* The reason we use range(3, n + 1) is because we are checking substrings of increasing sizes, not indexes.
### Determining 'i' and 'j':

* i is the starting index, looping from 0 to n - length + 1 so we don’t go out of bounds.
* j is the ending index, found using i + length - 1 to correctly span substrings.
### Checking Palindrome Condition:

* We check if the first and last characters (s[i] == s[j]).
* Then, we check the inner part using dp[i + 1][j - 1], ensuring the substring between i and j is also a palindrome.
### Now, your last question:

What about the strings in between?

That's exactly what dp[i + 1][j - 1] is doing! Instead of checking each middle character manually, it relies on previously computed results. If the substring between i and j is already marked as True (meaning it’s a palindrome), then and only then do we set dp[i][j] = True.

That way, we build palindromes from smaller ones instead of checking each middle character every time.

### Step 2: Check for Two-Character Palindromes
If s[i] == s[i+1], mark dp[i][i+1] = True:

* "ba" ❌ (not a palindrome)
* "ab" ❌
* "ba" ❌
* "ad" ❌

Since no adjacent letters match, the DP table remains unchanged.

### Step 3: Checking for Substrings of Length ≥ 3
Now, we check substrings of length 3 (length = 3):

* "bab" (i=0, j=2) ✅ → s[0] == s[2] and dp[1][1] == True
* "aba" (i=1, j=3) ✅ → s[1] == s[3] and dp[2][2] == True
* "bad" (i=2, j=4) ❌

### Step 4: Checking for Length 4
* "baba" (i=0, j=3) ❌ (s[0] != s[3])
* "abad" (i=1, j=4) ❌

No updates.

### Step 5: Checking for Length 5
* "babad" (i=0, j=4) ❌

No updates.

### Final Answer:

Since max_length = 3, we return "bab" (or "aba", both are valid).
